I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematics at Lehigh University. My work is, broadly speaking in algebraic geometry. My research is related to the following topics.
* Hodge theory,
* Tropical and toric geometry,
* Calabi-Yau varieties,
* Holomorphic symplectic varieties,
* Feynman integrals and amplitudes.
